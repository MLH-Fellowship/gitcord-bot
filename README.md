## Damir Temir - @dtemir

I wanted to build something for two major DevOps platforms like Discord and GitHub. 
I also wanted to work in a new programming language for me, using the technologies I wouldn't have otherwise used. 

I certainly enjoyed building this project because we collaborated closely as a team to learn and develop together. 
We properly managed our time and resources, distributing work based on everyone's availability and time zones.

My contributions include setting up a **CockroachDB** instance with Sequelize ORM. 
I have also helped setting up the Discord Bot and refactoring code for efficiency and cohesiveness.
