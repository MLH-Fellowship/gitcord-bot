# üí° Why We Built GitCord Bot

We were inspired to create Discord Bot based on our experiences in the first week of the MLH Pre-Fellowship collaborating with a team of 13 fellow pod members. Having a GitHub feed in one of our Discord channels was great for keeping up to date with GitHub activity but for some members it was overwhelming.

Communicating in Discord was great for immediate quick communication with team members with direct mentions but then we'd have to crosspost information to the relevant GitHub issues and PRs to keep them up to date to store our project history.

This was time-consuming so we wondered if there was a reverse integration where we could post messages on Discord mentioning a specific issue or PR and store the repo we wanted to use and then it would comment on GitHub for us while being able to use Discord mentions to notify teammates.

From our research, there wasn't so we decided that it would be a great idea to create one. Thus GitCord Bot was born.

Often times, the performance and accessibility of a page is not paid much attention to, so we have integrated the Lighthouse feature, which lets you scan a website and receive scores using Lighthouse, through Discord itself! There is no need to open Chrome Dev Tools or install the Lighthouse extension, and you can easily access the scores using Gitcord.

We wanted to create an easy way to be able to analyse our favourite sites and access the technologies used by it, without using another site or extension. That's how we thought of implementing the tech scanner feature from Discord itself.


# üéØ GitCord Bot Features

I wanted to work on the project because I've hadn't created a Discord Bot or used the GitHub API before so it seemed like an exciting new project to tackle and the features we were developing would solve real pain points us and fellow developers had so the project would bring great benefits to the developer community.

I really enjoyed working on the project because since the dev team was small, we worked closely as a tight-knit team, helping each other out with pair programming sessions when we faced any issues or blockers despite the distributed nature of our team. We all learned about new technologies and aspects of coding languages that we can use in the future.

We used GitHub to great effect with main, staging and feature branches and I set up GitHub Projects for project management and assigned issues and PRs to team members, added labels and created and managed milestones which helped us to manage the project. Added a GitHub action to automatically adding new issues and PRs to our GitHub Project helped automate this workflow.

The main features I implemented were surrounding the GitHub API. I integrated the GitHub API with our bot and created all the GitHub bot commands. I also helped refactor the code based on feedback from our code reviews, setup linting, formatting and autoprefixer and host our bot on Linode (with PM2 to manage and daemonize our Node app) and website on Netlify.

While participating in hackathons and also for various events like the MLH pre-fellowship, I have used discord effectively and always felt it would have been better to have a discord bot as a developer tool, helping developers while they collaborate on discord. This inspired me to work on creating a discord bot, which I know would be useful for many developers, including myself.

Throughout ths project, I got to play around with various new technologies like Discord.js, Lighthouse and Wappalyzer. As we were a small team, we worked closely to brainstorm features, thinking what might be useful for developers. Our extensive use of Github to collaborate and work effectively strengthened my Git skills to a great extent.The constant reviewing of our code by our team mates and mentor helped us learn the best practices when it came to clean, efficient and reusable code. Despite our timezones and other commitments, our team managed to dedicatedly work on this project, helping each other out with any issues and learning new technologies on the way.

The main features that I worked on consist of implementing the lighthouse feature for the bot, and showing the tech stacks used by a site from discord itself (using the Wappalyzer API). I worked on adding the dynamic help command and refactored the code to make it more modular. I also worked on developing and styling the website for our bot, which is integrated with discord to be able to download the bot into a server.

I wanted to build something for two major DevOps platforms like Discord and GitHub. I also wanted to work in a new programming language for me, using the technologies I wouldn't have otherwise used.

I certainly enjoyed building this project because we collaborated closely as a team to learn and develop together. We properly managed our time and resources, distributing work based on everyone's availability and time zones.

My contributions include setting up a **CockroachDB** instance with Sequelize ORM. I have also helped setting up the Discord Bot and refactoring code for efficiency and cohesiveness.

# üíª Technologies

We used a range of technologies in order to create GitCord Bot. Some were from our sponsors who sponsored the MLH Pre-Fellowship which we built our bot during (which we've highlighted below), some were vital to developing functionality (such as the GitHub API and Discord API) and others provided nice additions to our developer environment such as the linters and formatters we used.

# üôã Contributing

We welcome contributors to our GitCord Bot project. Feel free to take on any open issues marked v2 by forking our repo, creating a new branch off of main and then submitting a PR. Please adhere to our codebase conventions, git workflow and PR template as outlined below to ensure the greatest chance of your PR being approved and merged.

## Contribution Guide

1. Open a new issue for working on any new features

- Our GitHub action will automatically add it to our GitHub Project but please add the v2 milestone and appropriate label: documentation, enhancement, question, bug or help wanted.

2. Create a new branch from main with the name of the feature you will be working on - i.e. token validation

- Please create a branch per issue as it makes it easier to review PRs. One exception is documentation updates where you can use the docs branch.

3. Ensure your code meets the standards of our linters and desired formatting

- We use ESLint and StyleLint for JS and CSS linting as well as prettier for autoformatting to our desired configuration through config files stored in our repo

- For easiest compliance, install the appropriate extensions (ESLint, StyleLint and Prettier) in your code editor or alternatively, use the command line.

4. Save any new node modules to the `package.json` using `npm install` or `npm install --save-dev` for developer-only node modules

5. Create a PR from your fork to the base branch: staging

- Follow the template to ensure your PR is descriptive enough to allow us to easily review it. As with issues, add an appropriate label and the v2 milestone. Finally, add one of the team as a reviewer so we can review your PR and hopefully approve it.

## Codebase Overview

Below is an overview of the files you may want to edit to contribute new code. Please do not edit any of the other configuration files unless your PR is directly related to them and we have approved your issue.

- `main.js` - The main.js file handles initialisation of Discord.js and Octokit.js to run our bot and access the GitHub API. The relevant Discord objects `command, message, args` and GitHub object `octokit` are then passed to our command files in the `commands` folder when a specified command is run.

- `database.js` - The database.js file handles the connection to CockroachDB and fetching, inserting, updating and deleting the user's GitHub Personal Access Token for use with the GitHub API

- `commands/` - The commands folder contains all the `.js` files for every bot command.

To create a new bot command, just copy an existing file and rename it to the command name you wish to use. Next, edit the name,  description, usage and example parameters in `module.exports` and finally, update the command name in the `if` statement and then remove and rewrite the bot command code below as needed.

- `site/` - The site folder contains the HTML, CSS and assets for the [GitCord Website](https://gitcord.tech), hosted on Netlify. The website is a static site that uses the Bootstrap CSS framework. Autoprefixer is used to automatically add necessary vendor prefixes to the CSS when `npm start` is run.
