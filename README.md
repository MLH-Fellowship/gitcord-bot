## Damir Temir - @dtemir

I wanted to build something for two major DevOps platforms like Discord and GitHub. I also wanted to work in a new programming language for me, using the technologies I wouldn't have otherwise used.

I certainly enjoyed building this project because we collaborated closely as a team to learn and develop together. We properly managed our time and resources, distributing work based on everyone's availability and time zones.

My contributions include setting up a **CockroachDB** instance with Sequelize ORM. I have also helped setting up the Discord Bot and refactoring code for efficiency and cohesiveness.

# 💻 Technologies

## Sponsor Technologies

- CockroachDB (Distributed Database with Standard SQL)
- .tech domain (Build the Future on .tech)
- Linode (Cloud Computing & Linux Servers)

## Other Technologies

- GitHub API
- Discord API
- Netlify

# 🙋 Contributing

We welcome contributors to our GitCord Bot project. Feel free to take on any open issues marked v2 by forking our repo, creating a new branch off of main and then submitting a PR. Please adhere to our codebase conventions, git workflow and PR template as outlined below to ensure the greatest chance of your PR being approved and merged.

1. Open a new issue for working on any new features

- Our GitHub action will automatically add it to our GitHub Project but please add the v2 milestone and appropriate label: documentation, enhancement, question, bug or help wanted.

2. Create a new branch from main with the name of the feature you will be working on - i.e. token validation

- Please create a branch per issue as it makes it easier to review PRs. One exception is documentation updates where you can use the docs branch.

3. Ensure your code meets the standards of our linters and desired formatting

- We use ESLint and StyleLint for JS and CSS linting as well as prettier for autoformatting to our desired configuration through config files stored in our repo

- For easiest compliance, install the appropriate extensions (ESLint, StyleLint and Prettier) in your code editor or alternatively, use the command line.

4. Create a PR from your fork to the base branch: staging

- Follow the template to ensure

Similar to Installation - Developer but details on how to submit PRs, branching methodologies and any coding conventions - style/variable names etc.
